## My process

Step 1 - Make a structure of a section. eg.- navbar or hero section
Step 2 - Apply CSS and Bootstrap
Step 3 - Make it responsive for Mobile and Tablet screens
Step 4 - Go to the next section and Repeat from Step 1.
End - Connect the Hyperlinks, Add Favicon and commit to the GitHub.
Post End - ReadMe file add and commit to git.

### Built with

-Semantic HTML5 markup
-CSS custom properties
-Flexbox
-Bootstrap grid, Carousel, Navs & Tabs, Forms
-AOS
-Media query
-Fontawesome icons
-Favicon

### What I learned

Sometimes Bootstrap by default adds margin with negative unit for some components, which when viewed from a Mobile screen shows Alignment Problems. We have to manually adjust it through Inline CSS or External CSS with "!important" value.

### Continued development

Any Suggestions?
